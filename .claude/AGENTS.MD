# Agent Instructions

## Knowledge Base

The `knowledge/` folder is your knowledge base.

- **Any missing info you need, search there first.**
- **Anything useful you see, dump there.**

Use very descriptive filenames: `a_very_descriptive_file_name.md`

### Guidelines

- Before making assumptions, check if info exists in `knowledge/`
- After solving a problem or discovering something useful, document it
- Use Glob/Grep to search for relevant files
- Keep files focused on specific topics for easy retrieval
